The Egyptian Museum is one of the largest and most famous international museums, 
located in the heart of the Egyptian capital, Cairo, on the northern side of Tahrir Square.
Its construction dates back to the year 1835, and its location was then in Azbakeya Park, 
where it included a reasonable number of various antiquities at that time. 
Then it was transferred with its contents to the second exhibition hall in the Salah al-Din Citadel, 
until the French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, who was working at the Louvre Museum, 
thought of opening a museum in which the collection would be displayed.
Among the antiquities on the shore of the Nile at Bulaq, and when these antiquities
began to flood, they were transferred to a special annex in the palace of Khedive Ismail 
in Giza. Then the Egyptologist Gaston Maspero came and in 1902, during the reign of Khedive
Abbasid II, he inaugurated the new museum building in its current location in the heart of 
Cairo.
